# sunny-autographs
Script for moderately-sized Japan

`autograph.js` is standard Javascript code for this project.

`autograph_wp.js` includes the... modifications I had to make to get it running on Wordpress with limited permissions and an outdated version of jQuery (isn't that redundant?). Must include in a wordpress post, wrapped in HTML comment tags like the good ol' Netscape days.
